Summary: Details on SSD 2013

We've revamped the webpage and are getting started on SSD2013! So mark
your calendars for Dec. 16 and 17. To follow along book mark the
[SSD2013 details page](|filename|/pages/2013_detail.md). 

This year we have already lined up two amazing speakers, Neil Chue
Hong and James Howison.  Both these gentlemen have made their name
analyzing and promoting sustainable scientific software.  

A few other changes are taking place.  We plan on going back to the
two day format.  With one day for interesting tutorials and the second
for our speaker series. Additionally with the success of last year, we
are getting a bigger room!

Look forward to seeing you there.
