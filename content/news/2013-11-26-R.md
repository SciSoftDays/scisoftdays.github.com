<h3>Description</h3>

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a large number of statistical tools and is highly extensible. We will cover the basics of R and focus on the R extensions that enable high throughput and parallel computing with R. Specifically, we will focus on how to use these extensions (and other performance improvement tools) on TACC supercomputers.
