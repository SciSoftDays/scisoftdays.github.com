# The 7th Annual **Scientific Software Days Conference**
# Austin, Texas
# February 25--26, 2016

## About

Scientific Software Days (SSD) is a successful regional conference that has been
held for seven years running at the University of Texas, Austin. This year we
are seeking to expand the impact of the conference to a national scale.   The
target audience are users and developers of scientific software, and the goals
of the conference are two fold:

- Share best practices among scientific software communities.
- Share the latest tools and technology relevant to scientific software.

Past keynotes speakers include Greg Wilson (2008), Victoria Stodden
(2009), Steve Easterbrook (2010), Fernando Perez (2011), Aleksandra
Pawlik and Will Schroeder (2012), and Neil Chue Hong (2013).

## Poster Session

A poster session will be held on **Thursday, February 25**,
where participants can share their work related to scientific software.
Posters may present specific scientific libraries, packages, frameworks,
etc.; they may also present work addressing common issues in scientific
software development, such as reproducibility, verification, profiling,
portability, performance, etc.

If you are interested in participating, please email the conference
organizers [ssd-organizers@googlegroups.com](mailto:ssd-organizers@googlegroups.com)
and include the **names of all authors**, the
**title**, and an **abstract (max. 75 words)**
for your poster.  Poster presenters may also prepare **2-3
slides** for a lightning talk before the poster session, if they
choose.
