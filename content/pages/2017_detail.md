# The 8th Annual **Scientific Software Days Conference**
# Austin, Texas
# April 27--28, 2017

## About

Scientific Software Days (SSD) is a successful regional conference that has been
held for eight years running at the University of Texas, Austin. This year we
are seeking to expand the impact of the conference to a national scale. The
target audience are users and developers of scientific software, and the goals
of the conference are two fold:

- Share best practices among scientific software communities.
- Share the latest tools and technology relevant to scientific software.

Past keynotes speakers include Greg Wilson (2008), Victoria Stodden (2009),
Steve Easterbrook (2010), Fernando Perez (2011), Aleksandra Pawlik and Will
Schroeder (2012), Neil Chue Hong (2013), Jeff Hammond and Robert van de Geijn
(2016).
