I'm excited to announce the 2013 Scientific Software Days [schedule]({{root_url}}/meetings/2012/#schedule) is official
posted.  This year we have a range of core technology talks, open science
talks, and software in applications talks.  In what may be a first for SSD, we
have two speakers from medical schools, a growing segment in scientific
software user base.

Coming soon, we will have logistics information up soon for all to see.  But if
you have any questions feel free to email us at softwareday@tacc.utexas.edu.
