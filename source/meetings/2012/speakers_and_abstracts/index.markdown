##  <a id="demeler"></a>Biophysics and HPC: The UltraScan XSEDE Science Gateway

> [Borries Demeler](http://www.demeler.uthscsa.edu/)  
> UT Health Science Center San Antonio

UltraScan is a software package for the analysis of biophysical data from experiments investigating solution properties of macromolecules. This presentation will discuss the analysis workflow used to solve a complex computational problem. We describe the UltraScan-3 XSEDE Gateway, which provides a unique analysis environment that  combines multiple tools and layers, including MySQL databases, the XSEDE HPC infrastructure, multi-platform GUI software, a PHP-based LIMS web frontend, and the Apache Airavata Generic Factory (GFAC) into a powerful analysis toolchain. Together, these components provide an easy-to-learn and user-friendly, yet very flexible analysis environment for remote HPC analysis and large data management.

## <a id="james"></a>Having It Both Ways: Eclipse PTP on Desktop and Cluster

> [Doug James](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/staff/douglas-james)  
> Texas Advanced Computing Center

This is an overview of [Eclipse PTP](www.eclipse.org/ptp), a robust, open source, multi-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supporting the development of parallel applications in C, C++, and Fortran.  PTP also delivers customized, tight integration with XSEDE (including TACC's) clusters. Developers can use PTP on their desktops to develop, build, debug, manage, submit and monitor remote jobs on XSEDE resources; they can also create "synchronized projects" that reside on both their desktops and remote clusters. Eclipse PTP offers a promising path for improving both code quality and developer productivity; the presenter hopes to increase its visibility and promote its use.

## <a id="morin"></a>Supporting research computing through scientific software collaboratives

> [Andrew Morin](http://hkl.hms.harvard.edu/)  
> Harvard Medical School

The burdens of supporting, maintaining and administering the ever-growing
libraries of scientific software required for modern laboratory research can
place a significant burden on researchers and research groups.  The SBGrid
Consortium has successfully established a community-based collaborative model
for scientific software support in the field of structural biology. SBGrid
deploys and maintains a comprehensive library of structural biology software to
workstations in member laboratories automatically, without need of end-user
intervention, thus relieving researchers of software self-support burdens.
This talk will describe the highly generalizable features, methods and
technologies behind SBGridâ€™s success so that other scientific fields might
benefit from organizing their own SBGrid-style community-based software
collaborative.

## <a id="oliphant"></a>Fortran speed in Python: Numba the Python LLVM Compiler

> [Travis Oliphant](http://www.continuum.io/our-team.html#travis)  
> Continuum Analytics, Inc

Numba is a Python bytecode to LLVM translator that allows creation of fast, machine code from Python functions. The Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) project is rapidly becoming a hardware-industry standard for the intermediate representation (IR) of compiled codes. Numba's high-level translator to the LLVM IR provides Python the ability to take advantage of the machine code generated by the hardware manufacturers contributions to LLVM. Numba translates a Python function comprised of a subset of Python syntax to machine code using simple type inference and the creation of multiple machine-code versions. In this talk, I will describe the design of Numba, illustrate its applications to multiple domains and discuss the enhancements to NumPy and SciPy that can benefit from this tool.

## <a id="poole"></a>Data Processing for the NASA GRACE Mission

> [Steve Poole](http://www.csr.utexas.edu/info/staff/poole.html)  
> Center for Space Research, UT Austin

The NASA GRACE satellite mission obtains a set of global high-resolution
gravity measurements which are used to solve for an Earth gravity model every
month.  The procedures used to create this monthly gravity model will be
discussed, including the challenges involved in getting large amounts of data
ready for processing, keeping large data files on-line during the processing,
condensing the data into manageable-size files for use in creating multi-year
mean gravity models, and archiving the results.  The software used to solve for
the gravity model, the Advanced Equation Solver for Parallel Systems (Aesop),
will be discussed.

## <a id="turk"></a> The yt Project: Growing and Engaging a Community of Practice

> [Matthew Turk](https://sites.google.com/site/matthewturk/)  
> Columbia University

In this talk, I will present on the [yt Project](http://yt-project.org/) an
analysis and visualization tool for astrophysical simulations.  I will provide
a brief motivation for its development, describe its capabilities for analysis
of astrophysical simulation data, and then describe the method by which the
community attempts to balance pragmatic, goal-driven development with best
practices in software development and high-performance computing.
